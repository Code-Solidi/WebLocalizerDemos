# WebLocalizerDemos
WebLocalizer demo projects:

- [WebLocalizerDemo](https://github.com/Code-Solidi/WebLocalizerDemos/edit/master/WebLocalizerDemo) - Demonstrates localization of static texts in a [ASP.NET MVC](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/mvc) application.
- [WebLocalizerDemoDynamic](https://github.com/Code-Solidi/WebLocalizerDemos/tree/master/WebLocalizerDemoDynamic) - Demonstrates dynamic objects property localization. Dynamic are CLR objects which take part in the HTML rendered by ASP.NET MVC and are usually stored to and retrieved from an external source, e.g. database.
- [WebLocalizerDemoGreekDefault](https://github.com/Code-Solidi/WebLocalizerDemos/tree/master/WebLocalizerDemoGreekDefault) - Demonstrates a project default language that is not English. This demo defaults to *Greek*.
- [WebLocalizerRazorPagesDemo](https://github.com/Code-Solidi/WebLocalizerDemos/tree/master/WebLocalizerRazorPagesDemo) - This demo demonstrates how [Razor pages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=visual-studio) are localized. 
- [WebLocalizerBlazorSrvDemo](https://github.com/Code-Solidi/WebLocalizerDemos/tree/master/WebLocalizerBlazorSrvDemo) - This demo demonstrates how server-side (SS) [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) both static and dynamic texts are localized. 

The demos now include a demo account with "real" credentials (demo@weblocalizer.eu/Password-2021). 

**WARNING:** This account was created to make it easier get familiar with WebLocalizer and is _not intended_ for other purposes. This will lead to misbehavior when trying to use with non-demo projects.
