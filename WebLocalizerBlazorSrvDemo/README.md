# WebLocalizerBlazorSrvDemo

**WebLocalizer** demo project. Download, build and run after creating an account in www.weblocalizer.eu. 

This demo demonstrates how server-side (SS) [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) are localized. 

Replace the demo credentials with "real" ones in appsettings.json:

    "WebLocalizer": {
        "UserEmail": "demo@weblocallizer.eu",  <-- replace with your email
        "Password": "Password-2021" <--  replace with your password
    }
 
**NB:** Despite just a demo project read the following <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=windows">article</a> if you want to use *ASP.NET Core Secrets* to store your credentials. 

**WARNING:** This account was created to make it easier get familiar with WebLocalizer and is _not intended_ for other purposes. This will lead to misbehavior when trying to use with non-demo projects.

There are some <a target="_blank" href="https://www.weblocalizer.eu#videos">videos</a> you may wish to watch.

Enjoy!
